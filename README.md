# SA.-Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Python-Fundamentals---Compulsory

This is a challenge to write various python functions to complete a set of given tasks.The functions are divided into different files as explained below:

1. # Sum.py

    This is a function named add_numbers that takes two parameters num1 and num2, and returns the sum of the two numbers.

2. # evens.py

    This is a function named is_even that takes a single parameter number and returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.

3. # reverse_string.py

    This is a function named reverse_string that takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

4. # count.py

    This is a function named count_vowels that takes a string text as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

5. # calculate_factorial.py

    This is a function named calculate_factorial that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

6. # decorator.py

    This is a function named apply_decorator that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator simply prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

7. # sequences.py

    This is a function named sort_by_age that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order when given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an age.

8. # merge_dicts.py

    This is a function named merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.

9. # car.py

    This is a Python class named Car with the following attributes: make, model, year. It implements a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.
